Cursor Movement: 

h = left, j = down, k = up, l = right (the arrow keys often have the same effect) 
0 = move to front of line 
$ = move to end of line 
w = move forward one word 
b = move backward one word 
e = move forward to end of word 
^F = move forward a screenfull 
^B = move backward a screenfull 
^D = move forward half a screenfull 
^U = move backward half a screenfull 
G = move to end of file 
#G = move to line numbered #. (Ex: Use 0G to move to top of file.) 

Searching: 

n = repeat last search 
N = reverse direction of last search 
/pat = move cursor to next occurrance of pattern pat (forward search) 
?pat = move cursor to previous occurrance of pattern pat (backward search) 

Inserting: 

i = insert before (new text will appear before current cursor position) -- leaves you in insert mode 
a = append (new text appears after current cursor position) -- leaves you in insert mode 
o = open a new line below the current line 
O = open a new line above the current line 
rx = replace character under cursor with character x 
cwnewESC = change current word to new 

Deleting: 

^H = erase last character (usually same as backspace) 
dSPACE = delete the character beneath the cursor (SPACE == space bar) 
dw = delete rest of current word 
d$ = delete from cursor through end of current line 
dd = delete current line 
#dd = delete # lines (Ex: 3dd deletes the current line and the two following lines.) 

Saving & Loading: 

:w = write the file to the current file name (see also ^G, below) 
:wq = write the file to the current file name and exit vi when done 
ZZ = same as :wq 
:q = just quit vi. Will not work if any changes have been made 
:q! = quit vi, discarding all changes. Use with caution! 
:w name = save contents to a file named name. 
:r name = bring in the text stored in file name; insert it at this position. 

Misc: 

u = undo last change 
. = repeat last change 
\ = "escapes" a control character (Ex: in insert mode, to insert a ^H into your file, 
type: \^H Also, ^V has a similar effect.) 
^L = reprint screen (useful if it gets messed up with too many control characters) 
^G = show the name of the current file and the # of the current line 
% = find matching ( or ) or { or } 
#yy = 'yank' # lines, starting with the current line (like 'copy' in Windows) 
p = 'put' those lines just yanked after the current line (like 'paste' in Windows)
